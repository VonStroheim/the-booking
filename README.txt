== Description ==

TheBooking is a modern booking plugin to manage reservations.

Note: the plugin is in early stage of development, so please be patient. Suggestions, bug reports and feature requests are more than welcome.

#### User friendly booking plugin

With its reactive calendar widget and a step-by-step reservation process, TheBooking allows the users to book your services in a snap!

#### Availability plans

TheBooking implements an intuitive weekly planner to define working hours (i.e. the hours in which your services can be booked) and a comfortable year calendar to define vacations and day offs.

#### Reservation form

Define and customize a reservation form for each one of your services. TheBooking ships a nice form builder in which you can add custom fields, even set some conditional logic.

File upload fields are also available.

#### Service locations

If you offer some services in a specific location or want the customer to pick from a list of locations, you can do that with TheBooking. 

Google Maps is also supported.

#### Notification email messages

TheBooking is very powerful when it comes to the configuration of the perfect confirmation and cancellation email messages. Dynamic placeholders can be used to personalize the messages with customer's user data and service data.

#### Service restrictions

Services can be configured to be booked by registered users only.

#### Data export

Reservations and customers can be conveniently exported in *.CSV format.

3. Place the frontend calendar widget anywhere in your website using one of the following methods:
   * Use the WP block editor element (Elementor blocks are also provided).

## Email notifications
Email notifications can be configured per-service. To do that, go in `TheBooking > Services`, click on the cog icon of the desired service and select `Notifications` from the configuration side menu.

## Reservation form

###### WordPress booking plugin.


TheBooking is a modern booking plugin to manage reservations, focused on usability and nice-looking user interface.

**Notice**: this plugin is in early stage of development, so please be patient. Suggestions, bug reports and feature requests are more than welcome.

## Getting started
1. Create one or more services in `TheBooking > Services`
2. Configure the availability times and closing days in `TheBooking > Availability`
3. Place the frontend calendar widget anywhere in your website using one of the following methods:
   * Use the WP block editor element (Elementor blocks are also provided).
   * Use the `[tbk-booking]` shortcode.
    
## Email notifications
Email notifications can be configured per-service. To do that, go in `TheBooking > Services`, click on the cog icon of the desired service and select `Notifications` from the configuration side menu.

## Reservation form
In order to configure the reservation form for a given service, go in `TheBooking > Services`, click on the cog icon of the desired service and select `Data collection` from the configuration side menu.

The form builder is quite flexible. Conditional fields are also a feature.
